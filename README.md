# Hello! My name is Evelyn! 👋

### I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in [Art](https://sites.google.com/view/evelynsjohnson/about-me?authuser=0) at UIC.

- Contact me here 📫: evy.su.mei@gmail.com

I’ve had experience in many different coding languages throughout the years, and I’ve practiced developing small websites and games for a few of my classes, teaching me valuable lessons in user interface design and project management. I am enthusiastic about learning; specifically, I am looking to engage in development related to Software Development, Generative Artificial Intelligence, and Augmented Reality - mostly being able to make use of the skills I've aquired from being multidisciplinary.

I wholeheartedly enjoy using my knowledge to not only create tools that will help with efficiency and quality of life, but also to be able to teach others about everything I've learned. I have also found that my passion for exploring new concepts allows me to be able to pick up these new tools or skills on the fly.
