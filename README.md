# Hello! My name is Evelyn! 👋

### I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in [Art](https://sites.google.com/view/evelynsjohnson/about-me?authuser=0) at UIC.

- Contact me here 📫: evy.su.mei@gmail.com

I’ve had experience in many different coding languages throughout the years, and I’ve practiced developing small websites and games for a few of my classes, teaching me valuable lessons in user interface design and project management. I am enthusiastic about learning; specifically, I am looking to engage in development related to Software Development, Generative Artificial Intelligence, and Augmented Reality - mostly being able to make use of the skills I've aquired from being multidisciplinary.

I wholeheartedly enjoy using my knowledge to not only create tools that will help with efficiency and quality of life, but also to be able to teach others about everything I've learned. I have also found that my passion for exploring new concepts allows me to be able to pick up these new tools or skills on the fly.

In the past, I've worked as an intern at the University of Kentucky in a program called [EduceLab](https://educelab.engr.uky.edu), a unique ecosystem of non-destructive instrumentation capable of scanning in ancient scrolls and unraveling them digitally.

I studied under Stephen Parsons, learning how to navigate the software used to anaylize the fragile scrolls, collaborated with a team who worked to develop efficient methods for data extraction and interpretation, and later on also created posters based off models of the scrolls to promote the program and raise public awareness, for their events such as the Vesuvius Challenge - a competition created by Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, and Dr. Brent Seales.
