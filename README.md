I am passionate about learning the ins and outs of the field of technology, and I am fully capable of picking things up on the fly. I wholeheartedly enjoy using my knowledge to not only create tools that will help with efficiency and quality of life, but also to be able to teach others about everything I've learned. I have a particular interest in software development, web design, and data science - mostly being able to make use of the skills I've aquired from being multidisciplinary.

Skills: Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS.


Experiences üåê

In the past, I've worked as an intern at the University of Kentucky in a program called EduceLab, a unique ecosystem of non-destructive instrumentation capable of scanning in ancient scrolls and unraveling them digitally. I studied under Stephen Parsons, learning how to navigate the software used to achieve this, and later on also created posters based off models of the scrolls to promote the program and its components, such as the Vesuvius Challenge - a competition created by Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, and Dr. Brent Seales.

I currently have a Sprinternship with the Breakthrough Technologies Program this summer of 2024.
