# Hello! My name is Evelyn! üëã

### I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in [Art](https://sites.google.com/view/evelynsjohnson/about-me?authuser=0) at UIC.

In the past, I've worked as an intern at the University of Kentucky in a program called [EduceLab](https://educelab.engr.uky.edu), a unique ecosystem of non-destructive instrumentation capable of scanning in ancient scrolls and unraveling them digitally.

I studied under Stephen Parsons, learning how to navigate the software used to anaylize the fragile scrolls, collaborated with a team who worked to develop efficient methods for data extraction and interpretation, and later on also created posters based off models of the scrolls to promote the program and raise public awareness, for their events such as the Vesuvius Challenge - a competition created by Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross, and Dr. Brent Seales.

I am enthusiastic about learning. More specifically, with regards to Software Development, Machine Learning/AI, and Augmented Reality - mostly being able to make use of the skills I've aquired from being multidisciplinary.

I wholeheartedly enjoy using my knowledge to not only create tools that will help with efficiency and quality of life, but also to be able to teach others about everything I've learned. I have also found that my passion for exploring new concepts allows me to be able to pick up these new tools or skills on the fly.

‚öôÔ∏è Skills: C++, C, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS.

Experience with Autodesk Inventor (ü¶á A batmobile was made in the process)

I currently have a Sprinternship with the [Break Through Technologies](https://chicago.breakthroughtech.org) Program this summer of 2024.
